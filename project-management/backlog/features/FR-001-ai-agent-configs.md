# Feature Request: FR-001 - AI Agent Configuration Files

[← Back to Product Backlog](../product-backlog.md)

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Created**: 2026-02-14  
**Updated**: 2026-02-16  
**Assigned Sprint**: Sprint 1

## Description

Create project-specific configuration files for AI agents (Cursor, Copilot, Antigravity, and Claude Code) to provide context and instructions tailored to this repository's structure and standards.

## User Story

As a developer using AI tools, 
I want the AI agents to understand the project's specific management structure and coding standards automatically, 
so that I can receive more accurate and relevant assistance without manual context providing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.cursorrules` file created in the root directory.
- [x] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file created.
- [x] `.agent/instructions.md` file created for Antigravity.
- [x] `.claudecode/instructions.md` file created for Claude Code.
- [x] All files contain a summary of the `project-management` structure and the use of the `backlog-toolkit`.

## Business Value

Improves developer productivity and ensures consistency across AI-guided contributions by embedding project "know-how" directly into the environment.

## Technical Requirements

- Files must use Markdown or the specific syntax required by the agent (e.g., Cursor rules).
- Must include references to the `project-management/` directory.
