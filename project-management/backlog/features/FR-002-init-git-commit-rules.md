# Feature Request: FR-002 - Git Initialization and Commit Standards

[← Back to Product Backlog](../product-backlog.md)

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Priority**: 🟠 High  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Created**: 2026-02-14  
**Updated**: 2026-02-16  
**Assigned Sprint**: Sprint 1

## Description

Ensure the project is initialized with Git and establish a mandatory, structured commit message format for all AI assistants to follow. This format requires a business-focused paragraph followed by technical implementation details.

## User Story

As a developer and stakeholder, 
I want commit messages to clearly communicate both the business impact and technical changes of every commit, 
so that the project history is readable for both management and engineering teams.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Project is initialized with `git init` if not already a repository.
- [x] AI configuration files (`.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.agent/instructions.md`, `.claudecode/instructions.md`) updated with the "Git commit message generation" preset.
- [x] Commit message format includes:
  - [x] Subject line: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (Max 50 chars).
  - [x] Body 1: Business-focused paragraph (Why/Benefit).
  - [x] Body 2: Technical bullet points (Implementation/Performance/Trade-offs).
  - [x] Footer: Issue/PR references.

## Technical Requirements

- Run `test -d .git || git init` in the terminal.
- Update agent files with the exact rules provided in the standard.

## History

- 2026-02-14 - Created and status changed to ⏳ In Progress
- 2026-02-14 - Status changed to ✅ Completed after Git initialization and agent config updates
