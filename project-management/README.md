# Project Management Workflow

This directory contains the documentation and processes for managing the project backlog, features, bugs, and sprints.

## How to use this workflow with AI

To have the AI assist you with project management tasks (like creating feature requests or bug reports), follow these steps:

1. **Add the Process Document**: Add the following file to your chat:
   `project-management/docs/processes/backlog-management-process.md`

2. **Use the following prompt format**:
   > "I want you to create a feature request to do x and y and z."

## What this workflow does

The `project-management` workflow, guided by the LLM, automates and standardizes the following processes:

- **Backlog Management**: Maintaining a prioritized list of features and bugs in `product-backlog.md`.
- **Feature/Bug Lifecycle**: Managing the state of items from "Not Started" to "Completed" using standardized templates.
- **Sprint Planning**: Organizing items into sprints and breaking them down into actionable tasks.
- **Dependency Tracking**: Identifying and managing technical and functional dependencies between backlog items.
- **Documentation**: Ensuring all features and bugs are documented according to project standards.

By providing the `backlog-management-process.md` file, the AI understands the specific file structure, naming conventions, and status transitions required for this project.
